0x09. Web Infrastructure Design
Project Overview
This project focuses on understanding and implementing web infrastructure design principles. It covers concepts such as DNS, monitoring, web server, network basics, load balancer, and servers. The project is to be completed in teams of three people, with ongoing work starting on Nov 23, 2023, and ending by Dec 2, 2023, at 5:00 AM. The project is a second chance opportunity and requires manual QA review.

Concepts
For this project, participants are expected to explore and comprehend the following concepts:

DNS
Monitoring
Web Server
Network basics
Load balancer
Server
Learning Objectives
At the end of the project, participants are expected to:

Draw a diagram covering the web stack built in previous sysadmin/devops track projects.
Explain the function of each component in the web infrastructure.
Describe system redundancy.
Be familiar with acronyms such as LAMP, SPOF, QPS.
Copyright - Plagiarism
Plagiarism is strictly forbidden, and any form of it will result in removal from the program. Participants must come up with solutions independently to meet the learning objectives.

Requirements
General
A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
Whiteboard each task, take a picture/screenshot, and provide the link in the answer file.
Tasks will be manually reviewed.
Focus on answering what is asked, avoiding unnecessary details.
No computer or notes during whiteboarding sessions.
Tasks
0. Simple web stack

Identify issues with this infrastructure.
Provide URLs for the repository and whiteboard screenshot.
3. Scale up
Introduce a cluster configuration for load balancing.
Split components with their own servers.
Explain additional elements and their purpose.
Provide URLs for the repository and whiteboard screenshot.
Project Structure
The project should be organized into the following directories:

GitHub repository: alx-system_engineering-devops
Directory: 0x09-web_infrastructure_design
File: 0-simple_web_stack
File: 1-distributed_web_infrastructure
File: 2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure
File: 3-scale_up
Conclusion
This project aims to reinforce understanding of web infrastructure design principles, preparing participants to explain and implement these concepts independently.
